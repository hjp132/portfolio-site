            <h2>Can I Use? Bot</h2>
            <p>
                This is a small simple bot I made during the COVID-19 lockdown.

                    <h2>The concept</h2>
                    <p>This little project's aim was to make a bot that could be used in Slack or in Discord that you
                        could type
                        !CIU and then be able to see if you could use certain CSS styling and what browsers support the
                        feature.
                        It uses an API from caniuse.com which is a site that lets you see information about each style
                        property
                    </p>

                    <h2>What I learnt from this</h2>
                    <p></b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I learnt more about how to create and develop bots for Slack and Discord.
                        </li>
                        <li>I have learnt a lot in regards how you should treat the user and how to properly design
                            something that would mean that the user can't break it but also making the process simple
                            and responsive for the user, making sure that the information given back to them is
                            something that they want and that the information given is good and also clearly presented
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
